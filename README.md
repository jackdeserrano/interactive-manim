## Interactive Manim
Requires an up-to-date version of [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). Made for my learning.
### Trivia ([deprecated](https://github.com/jackdeserrano/trivia_interface))
Navigate to the `trivia` directory and run `manimgl trivia.py Trivia`. Click the screen to go through questions and answers. On a prompt, you can press `g` and then guess what the answer to the prompt is. You can find these questions and others on [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/jack_deserrano/folders/scio/sets). Formatting incomplete.
### Flags
Navigate to the `flags` directory and run `manimgl flags.py Flags`. It's the same idea as the trivia one, except I didn't see a need for a guess option. I will add more flags eventually (maybe).
