## Interactive Manim
To use this, you will need an up-to-date version of [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). These little programs are not masterclasses in programming or necessarily user-friendly. They were made mostly for my learning.
### Trivia
Navigate to the `trivia` directory and run `manimgl trivia.py Trivia`. Click the screen to go through questions and answers. On a prompt, you can press `g` and then guess what the answer to the prompt is. You can find these questions and others on [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/jack_deserrano/folders/doctrina/sets). The formatting on all of the questions isn't perfect yet and will be tweaked in the near future.
### Flags
Navigate to the `flags` directory and run `manimgl flags.py Flags`. It's the same idea as the trivia one, except I didn't see a need for a guess option. I will add more flags soon.
